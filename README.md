# Material Toolbar
Toolbar skin for [MPC-HC](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc) that uses icons generated from [Material Design Symbols](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

Some small tweaks were made to make the icons line up with the pixel grid better.

## Usage
Place `toolbar.svg`, `toolbar_light.svg`, and `toolbar_dark.svg` in the MPC-HC installation folder.

## Variants
There are three weights, 200 (thin), 400 (regular), and 600 (bold). There is also the option of having the icons filled or not.
